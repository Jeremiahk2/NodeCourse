# NodeCourse
Learning project for Node, Jest, Typescript


Section Two:
I used the following command to make the initial package.json file:
npm init -y

I used the following command to make the package-lock.json and everything in node_modules:
npm i -D typescript jest ts-jest @types/jest ts-node

Then I used the following command to get the jest.config.js file:
npx ts-jest config:init
I then deleted that file because apparently it's not needed anymore.

Instead, use jest.config.ts
